  education2: Recent years have demonstrated the substantial threat that wildfires pose to communities across the U.S. The Community Networks in Fire-Environment Resilience (CoNIFER) project evaluates how local-level wildfire protection planning processes shape social interaction and consequently the implementation of risk mitigation measures at both local and regional scales. Collaborators include Jon Salerno (Colorado State), Eric Toman (Ohio State), Tony Cheng (Colorado State), Paige Fischer (University of Michigan), and Max Nielsen-Pincus (Portland State). The CoNIFER project is supported by the National Science Foundation Decision, Risk and Management Sciences Program.

  education2: Community Wildfire Protection Plans (CWPPs) are collaborative frameworks that outline local priorities for wildfire risk mitigation. Since CWPPs were introduced in the Healthy Forests Restoration Act two decades ago, thousands of plans have been developed across fire-prone regions of the US. Guidance for plan development is relatively vague, which has spurred considerable variation in the scope, scale, and goals of these planning processes. The CWPP Portal and Data Library offers 20,000+ records of individualsâ€™ participation in 1,000+ CWPPs in 11 states of the fire-prone US West, attributes of individuals and plans, and the plan documents themselves. All data are available for download. Collaborators include Max Nielsen-Pincus, Cody Evers, and Matt Bauer (Portland State) and Emily Palsa (Ohio State).

  education2: The "Identifying conditions for successful landscape-scale conservation policy implementation in Vietnam" project evaluates the interplay between conservation stakeholder networks and the ecological and livelihoods impacts of landscape-scale forest conservation in Vietnam. Collaborators include Thuy Pham (Center for International Forestry Research), Caleb Gallemore (Lafayette College), Darla Munroe (Ohio State), and Kimberly Ordonez (Ohio State). The project is supported by the United States Agency for International Development, through the Partnerships for Enhanced Engagement in Research (PEER) program.

#  education2: In this project, led by current PhD student Harrison Fried, and in collaboration with Matt Hamilton and Ramiro Berardo, climate change adaptation governance in Ohio is used as a model study system to evaluate conditions and incentives that drive actors to manage for interdependent issues or to participate in forums in ways that are collectively beneficial. We analyze climate change governance as a three-mode network of interrelations among actors, forums, and policy issues related to climate change adaption in Ohio.

  education2: In the greater Columbus area, there are many different organizations that perform environmental management actions to adapt to many different issues posed by climate change. Using Columbus climate change adaptation as a study system, this project aims to understand how environmental stakeholders navigate complex social-ecological settings. This project is led by current PhD students Harrison Fried and Kimberly Ordonez, as well as Matt Hamilton and Ramiro Berardo. This project is in collaboration with Joe Campbell and Cecil Okotah of the Environmental Professionals Network (EPN) and is funded by the Sustainability Institute (SI) at Ohio State.

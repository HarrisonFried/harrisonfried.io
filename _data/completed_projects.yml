  education2: Wildfires burn large areas of forestland each year throughout Oregonâ€™s Eastern Cascades, threatening human health and safety, local economies, and numerous ecosystem services. This project explored how diverse groups of people (forest owners, representatives of environmental groups, ranchers, fire department chiefs, members of the timber industry, representatives of federal and state agencies) conceptualize wildfire risk. The project mapped relationships among these groups of people to improve understanding of how patterns of social interaction relate to cognition of wildfire risk. Work was supported by the Directorate of Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences of the National Science Foundation (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1715053&HistoricalAwards=false">full description</a>).

  education2: In this project, led by current PhD student Harrison Fried, and in collaboration with Matt Hamilton and Ramiro Berardo, climate change adaptation governance in Ohio is used as a model study system to evaluate conditions and incentives that drive actors to manage for interdependent issues or to participate in forums in ways that are collectively beneficial. We analyze climate change governance as a three-mode network of interrelations among actors, forums, and policy issues related to climate change adaption in Ohio.

  education2: Wildfires burn large areas of forestland each year throughout Oregonâ€™s Eastern Cascades, threatening human health and safety, local economies, and numerous ecosystem services. This project explored how diverse groups of people (forest owners, representatives of environmental groups, ranchers, fire department chiefs, members of the timber industry, representatives of federal and state agencies) conceptualize wildfire risk. The project mapped relationships among these groups of people to improve understanding of how patterns of social interaction relate to cognition of wildfire risk. Work was supported by the Directorate of Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences of the National Science Foundation (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1715053&HistoricalAwards=false">full description</a>).

  education2: The project improved understanding of the role of institutions in developing adaptive capacity to the near-term effects of climate change in the Lake Victoria region of East Africa. Key adaptive capacity issues in the Lake Victoria region include disruptions to agricultural productivity, altered flood regimes, threats to the viability of fisheries, and shifts in plant and animal habitat suitability. Within the past few decades, numerous collaborative institutions have emerged to help address these adaptive capacity issues. This study explored factors that contribute to the structure of inter-organizational networks and policy networks, and evaluated how those networks function to improve adaptive capacity in the Lake Victoria region.

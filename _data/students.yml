  education2: Kimberly is a PhD student in Environmental Social Science and holds an interest in co-productive science, multi-scale behavioral adaptations to environmental pressures, and environmental justice. Her current projects include Climate Change related adaptations by environmental stakeholders in Ohio including Nongovernmental Organizations, private businesses, nonprofits, and federal offices. Her research goals involve expanding her studies into environmental justice and localized community acceptance of climate change adaptations. Kimberly hopes to one day work in a position of translational science, engaging communities and scientists alike, to assist in fair and realistic behavioral changes for a positive socio-ecological outcome. In the meantime, she enjoys exploring the Columbus food scene and walking her two dogs.

  education2: I adopt a social-ecological network approach to understand climate change adaptation governance, which is complex both socially and ecologically. My existing research is informed by several theories of environmental governance, including institutional (or social-ecological) fitness and the Ecology of Games Theory. I spend much of my time thinking about the factors or condititions that lead environmental stakeholding organizations to enter into partnerships, choose management actions, and attend governance forums, in ways that improve environmental outcomes.

  education2: Research interests, projects, etc. To this end, we develop novel spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM) tools to visualize the relevant quantum mechanical degrees of freedom. We want to be able to build the perfect instruments to answer the scientific questions we deem most important (see Research).

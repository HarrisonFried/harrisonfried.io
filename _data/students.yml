  education2: Research interests, projects, etc. To this end, we develop novel spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM) tools to visualize the relevant quantum mechanical degrees of freedom. We want to be able to build the perfect instruments to answer the scientific questions we deem most important (see Research).

  education2: I adopt a social-ecological network approach to understand climate change adaptation governance, which is complex both socially and ecologically. My existing research is informed by several theories of environmental governance, including institutional (or social-ecological) fitness and the Ecology of Games Theory. I spend much of my time thinking about the factors or condititions that lead environmental stakeholding organizations to enter into partnerships, choose management actions, and attend governance forums, in ways that improve environmental outcomes.

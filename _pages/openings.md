## Work with us!

We are always looking for new people to join our group. Note: we currently do not have funding for postdoctoral positions, but I (Hamilton) can support your application to external fellowships (e.g., through [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/education.jsp?fund_type=3)).

If you are interested in joining the SENS Lab as a **MS or PhD student**, email Matt Hamilton (hamilton.1323@osu.edu); please note your research experience, interests, and goals and attach your current resume/CV; please share your undergraduate GPA and GRE percentiles (if available). 

If you are interested in joining the SENS Lab as an **undergraduate student**, email Matt Hamilton (hamilton.1323@osu.edu); please include the same information as above (except GRE scores). Please also note your availability (e.g., hours per week).

### Master projects for Leiden University students
If you are a Master student at Leiden University looking for a Master project, contact me (or any group member) per email or stop by my office.

### Bsc / Master students from elsewhere
If you are interested in pursuing a Master degree at Leiden University, see [mastersinleiden.nl](http://www.mastersinleiden.nl/programmes/physics/en/introduction). Sometimes, we take master students or summer interns if we get exceptional applicants (this usually means very good grades and a personal recommendation).

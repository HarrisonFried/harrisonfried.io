## Research

**CoNIFER project**: Recent years have demonstrated the substantial threat that wildfires pose to communities across the U.S. The Community Networks in Fire-Environment Resilience (CoNIFER) project evaluates how local-level wildfire protection planning processes shape social interaction and consequently the implementation of risk mitigation measures at both local and regional scales. Collaborators include Eric Toman (Ohio State), Jon Salerno and Tony Cheng (Colorado State), Paige Fischer (University of Michigan), and Max Nielsen-Pincus (Portland State). The CoNIFER project is supported by the National Science Foundation Decision, Risk and Management Sciences Program.

**11 states CWPP project**: We have developed a novel cryogenic MHz amplifier that allows us to measure not only the average tunneling current, but also its fluctuation! This has many applications: one can detect the fluctuations of the electronic states, peculiar tunneling processes, and shot noise. We have used this instrument to discover charge trapping in the insulating layer of the cuprates, connected to the c-axis mystery, and to measure the doubling of the charge due to Andreev processes to the superfluid in a lead sample.
